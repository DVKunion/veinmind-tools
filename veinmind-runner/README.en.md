<p align="center">
veinmind-runner is a safety tool platform for pulse container developed by Changting Technology
</p>

## ðŸ“¸ Basic Introduction

With rich research and development experience as the background, Changting team designed a set of plug-in system in [veinmind-sdk](). With the support of the plugin system, you only need to call the API provided by [veinmind-sdk]() to automatically generate plug-ins that meet the standard specifications. (
See [example](./example)) for a code example.
As a plugin platform, 'veinmind-runner' will automatically scan for compliant plugins and pass the image information to the corresponding plugin.

## ðŸ”¥ Features

- Automatically scan and register plugins in the current directory (including subdirectories)
- Run different language plugins in one way
- Plugins can communicate with the 'runner' to alert on events, etc

## ðŸ’» Compatibility

- linux/amd64
- linux/386
- linux/arm64
- linux/arm

## ðŸ•¹ Usage

### Based on executable files

Please install ` libveinmind `, installation method can refer to [official documentation] (https://github.com/chaitin/libveinmind)
#### Makefile one-click command

```
make run ARG="scan xxx"
```
#### Compile your own executable file for scanning

Compile the executable
```
make build
```
Run the executable file for scanning
```
chmod +x veinmind-runner && ./veinmind-runner scan xxx
```
### Based on the parallel container pattern
Make sure you have 'docker' and 'docker-compose' installed on your machine
#### Makefile one-click command
```
make run.docker ARG="scan xxxx"
```
#### Build your own image for scanning
Build the 'veinmind-runner' image
```
make build.docker
```
Run the container to scan
```
docker run --rm -it --mount 'type=bind,source=/,target=/host,readonly,bind-propagation=rslave' veinmind-runner scan xxx
```
### With kubernetes helm
Install 'veinmind-runner' with 'Helm' on Kubernetes to schedule scanning tasks

Please install ` Helm `, installation method can refer to [official documentation] (https://helm.sh/zh/docs/intro/install/)

Install 'veinmind-runner'
Before, can be configured to perform parameter, refer to [documents] (https://github.com/chaitin/veinmind-tools/blob/master/veinmind-runner/script/helm_chart/README.md)

Install 'veinmind-runner' using Helm

```
cd ./veinmind-runner/script/helm_chart/veinmind
helm install veinmind .
```
## âš™ Use parameters
### Basic parameters
Refer to [veinmind-runner usage parameters documentation](docs/veinmind-runner.md)
### Advanced parameters
1. Support docker image blocking

```bash
# first
./veinmind-runner authz -c config.toml
# second
dockerd --authorization-plugin=veinmind-broker
```

The 'config.toml' contains the following fields

|        | **field name**    | **field properties** | **meanings**             |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| policy | action            | string               | behavior need to monitor |
|        | enabled_plugins   | []string             | use which plugins        |
|        | plugin_params     | []string             | each plugin parameters   |
|        | risk_level_filter | []string             | risk level               |
|        | block             | bool                 | whether block            |
|        | alert             | bool                 | whether alarm            |
| log    | report_log_path   | string               | scan log                 |
|        | authz_log_path    | string               | block services log       |

- the action in principle support [DockerAPI] (https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/#operation/) provides the operation interface
- Use the 'veinmind-weakpass' plugin to scan the 'ssh' server when 'creating a container' or 'pushing an image' and if a weak password is found, the risk level is' High '
This action is blocked and a warning is issued. Finally, the scan results are stored in 'plugin.log' and the risk results are stored in 'auth.log'.

``` toml
[log]
plugin_log_path = "plugin.log"
auth_log_path = "auth.log"
[listener]
listener_addr = "/run/docker/plugins/veinmind-broker.sock"
[[policies]]
action = "container_create"
enabled_plugins = ["veinmind-weakpass"]
plugin_paramas = ["veinmind-weakpass:scan.serviceName=ssh"]
risk_level_filter = ["High"]
block = true
alert = true
[[policies]]
action = "image_push"
enabled_plugins = ["veinmind-weakpass"]
plugin_params = ["veinmind-weakpass:scan.serviceName=ssh"]
risk_level_filter = ["High"]
block = true
alert = true
[[policies]]
action = "image_create"
enabled_plugins = ["veinmind-weakpass"]
plugin_params = ["veinmind-weakpass:scan.serviceName=ssh"]
risk_level_filter = ["High"]
block = true
alert = true
```
2. Plugin custom parameters
```
/veinmind-runner scan image -- [plugin name]:[Run plugin function cmd].[Parameter name]=[custom value]
```
Examples:
```
./veinmind-runner scan image -- veinmind-weakpass:scan/image.serviceName=ssh
```
